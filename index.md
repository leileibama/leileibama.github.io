Hi, I am Lei Lei. I am Professor of Applied Linguistics at the Department of English, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I joined SJTU in December 2020, and before that I worked as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) from 1997. I also worked as Visiting Scholar at the University of Alabama (2014-2015) and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (2017).  

I obtained my PhD in Applied Linguistics from SJTU in 2010, my MA in Applied Linguistics from HUST in 2006, and my BA in English from Central China Normal University (CCNU) in 1997. 

My research interest include corpus-driven analyses of second language writing and Academic English, particulary those based on natural language processing techniques. 

My publications appeared in journals such as _Applied Linguistics_, _Journal of English for Academic Purposes_, _System_, _Lingua_, and _Scientometrics_. I also published books at publishing houses such as Cambridge University Press and TESOL Press.
