# Hello

Hi, I am Lei Lei (雷蕾). I am Professor of Applied Linguistics at the Institute of Corpus Studies and Applications, Shanghai International Studies University (SISU). Before I joined SISU, I worked at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I also worked as Visiting Scholar at the University of Alabama (2014-2015) and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (2017).  

I obtained my PhD in Applied Linguistics from SJTU in 2010, my MA in Applied Linguistics from HUST in 2006, and my BA in English from Central China Normal University (CCNU) in 1997. 

## Research interests

My **research interests** include corpus-driven analyses of second language writing and (academic) English, particulary those based on natural language processing techniques. I am also interested in the use of bibliometric methods for the exploration of scientific literature in various disciplines.

My publications appeared in journals such as _Applied Linguistics_, _Language Teaching_, _Journal of English for Academic Purposes_, _System_, _Lingua_, and _Scientometrics_. I also published books at publishing houses such as Cambridge University Press and TESOL Press.

**Article published in _Language Teaching_**

Lei, Lei & Qin, Jie*. 2022. Research in foreign language teaching and learning in China (2012–2021). Language Teaching. 1–27. 10.1017/S0261444822000155.

**Abstract**

This article reviews selected research on foreign language teaching and learning published in local, high-impact journals in China over the past ten years (2012–2021). A bibliometric analysis was conducted to elicit the most frequently researched topics in the field, which were grouped into four categories, that is, language learning and use, language pedagogy, language learners and teachers, and Teaching English as a Foreign Language approaches/theories, and a number of sub-categories. This was then followed by an in-depth and critical review of 71 studies corresponding to those categories and sub-categories. The review concluded with a discussion of inadequacies and recommendations for future research. It is hoped that a review on the experience of Chinese practitioners and researchers’ efforts to promote foreign language education may contribute to language teaching research and development in the international field.

**Article published in _Scientometrics_**

Wen, Ju & Lei, Lei*. 2022. Adjectives and adverbs in life sciences across 50 years: implications for emotions and readability in academic texts. Scientometrics. 10.1007/s11192-022-04453-z.

**Abstract**

Writing in a clear and simple language is critical for scientific communications. Previous studies argued that the use of adjectives and adverbs cluttered writing and made scientific text less readable. The present study aims to investigate if the articles in life sciences have become more cluttered and less readable across the past 50 years in terms of the use of adjectives and adverbs. The data that were used in the study were a large dataset of 775,456 scientific texts published between 1969 and 2019 in 123 scientific journals. Results showed that an increasing number of adjectives and adverbs were used and the readability of scientific texts have decreased in the examined years. More importantly, the use of emotion adjectives and adverbs also demonstrated an upward trend while that of nonemotion adjectives and adverbs did not increase. To our knowledge, this is probably the first large scale diachronic study on the use of adjectives and adverbs in scientific writing. Possible explanations to these findings were discussed.

**Article published in _Lingua_**

Liu, K., Liu, Z., & Lei, L. (2022). Simplification in translated Chinese: An entropy-based approach. *Lingua*, 275, 103364, pp.1-14. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2022.103364 (SSCI)

**Abstract**

For a long time, translation researchers, particularly those working in corpus-based translation studies, have held the presumption that translated texts tend to be simpler in lexical and syntactical features than non-translated native texts. Such claims have led to the formulation of the simplification universal hypothesis in translation studies. However, this line of research which focuses predominantly on the investigation of individual linguistic features has failed to provide sufficient evidence to confirm the existence of the simplification universal. To a large extent, the lack of global quantitative indicators for evaluating the complexity level of the translated and non-translated texts has hindered progress in this field. The current study, using entropy as an indicator, analysed the linguistic complexity between translated and native Chinese from the information-theoretical perspective. Our research found that translational Chinese tends to be simpler than its non-translated counterpart at the lexical level based on unigram entropy, but not the syntactic level based on part-of-speech entropy. Our study has confirmed the use of entropy as a reliable measure for lexical and syntactic complexity in the field of translation studies.

## Books

**Lei, Lei & Liu, Dilin. 2021. _Conducting Sentiment Analysis_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.**

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108909679

This Element provides a basic introduction to sentiment analysis, aimed at helping students and professionals in corpus linguistics to understand what sentiment analysis is, how it is conducted, and where it can be applied. It begins with a definition of sentiment analysis and a discussion of the domains where sentiment analysis is conducted and used the most. Then, it introduces two main methods that are commonly used in sentiment analysis known as supervised machine-learning and unsupervised learning (or lexicon-based) methods, followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to perform sentiment analysis with R. The Element then provides two detailed examples or cases of sentiment and emotion analysis, with one using an unsupervised method and the other using a supervised learning method.


**Liu, Dilin & Lei, Lei. 2017. _Using Corpora for Language Learning and Teaching_. Alexandria, VA: TESOL Press.**

https://bookstore.tesol.org/using-corpora-for-language-teaching-and-learning-products-9781945351129.php

How can you use corpora in your classroom? With the increasing use of corpora in classrooms, the need to understand how to use corpora in language teaching is essential for today’s teachers. Using ample concrete examples, this book offers a step-by-step hands-on introduction to the use of corpora for teaching a variety of English language skills, such as grammar, vocabulary, and English academic writing. Using Corpora for Language Teaching and Learning offers a detailed discussion of basic essential corpus search and teaching procedures and activities, instructions on how to develop your own corpora for language instruction and research purposes, practical ideas about how to use corpora to develop teaching materials, and an annotated list of useful corpora and corpus tools (online). Gaining familiarity with how to use learner corpora will enable you to have a deeper understanding of your students’ learning and challenges.
